  <li>I've also used <b>Python</b> for data wrangling and data visualisation</li>
  <li>Outside of coding, I enjoy learning foreign languages, drawing, running, and baking</li>

</ul>

<h3>🌿 What I've been up to</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learning: Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Japanese</li>
  <li>Ongoing projects:
    <ul>
      <li>Frontend Mentor Challenges - You can find a compiled list of completed challenges <a href="https://fe-mentor-compilation.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
      <li>Monthly Baking Projects - Every month, I challenge myself to work around a theme (pies, bread, cookies, etc.)</li>
      <li><a href="https://wiki.mconsunji.com/">Personal Wiki</a> - I'm trying to learn in public whilst also keeping references for future me. Covers programming, baking, and cooking (among other things I'd like to talk about eventually).

      <li><a href="https://github.com/msunji/fsopen-2022">Fullstack Open 2022</a> - I'm also trying to refresh my knowledge and fill in some gaps by going through the 2022 Fullstack Open Course. Here's how I'm faring so far.
